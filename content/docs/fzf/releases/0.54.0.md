# [0.54.0](https://github.com/junegunn/fzf/releases/tag/v0.54.0)

(July 2024)

## Enabling line wrap with `--wrap`

fzf can now be configured to wrap long lines instead of truncating them.

* `--wrap` enables line wrapping
* `--wrap-sign=INDICATOR` specifies the indicator for wrapped lines.
  The default is `'â†³ '`.
* You can use `toogle-wrap` action to dynamically toggle wrapping
    * fzf by default binds `CTRL-/` and `ALT-/` to `toggle-wrap`

```sh {hl_lines=[3]}
declare -f | perl -0777 -pe 's/^}\n/}\0/gm' |
  bat --plain --language bash --color always |
  fzf --read0 --ansi --reverse --multi --highlight-line --wrap
```

I find this particularly useful when [browsing log streams with fzf][log]:

[log]: /fzf/tips/browsing-log-streams/

```sh
tail -f *.log | fzf --tail 100000 --tac --no-sort --exact --wrap
```

Or when browsing the command history via `CTRL-R` and there are long,
truncated commands. Now you can press `CTRL-/` or `ALT-/` to see the full
command.

Also, kill completion now enables line wrapping by default because it's
important to see the full command when you're deciding which process to kill.

## Empty pointer and marker signs

fzf now accepts empty strings for `--pointer` and `--marker` options. You can
use it to achieve a minimalistic look like this:

```sh
fzf --pointer '' --marker '' --prompt '' --info hidden --border --padding 1,2
```

## Improved `--sync` behavior

Prior to 0.54.0, `--sync` option would block the interface only until the
input stream is complete, so for a large input with an initial query, you
would notice fzf rendering the unfiltered list first, then replacing it with
the filtered list after a while. This is no longer the case. You'll only see
the final result.

```sh
seq 10000000 | fzf --sync --query 1
```

`--sync` also waits until all associated actions are complete. This allows you
to set up the initial state of the interface using `start`, `load`, or
`result` events without exposing the intermediate states to the user. See the
next section for an example.

## GET endpoint is available in `transform` and `execute`

With `--listen` option, fzf starts an HTTP server and you can get the current
state in JSON format via `GET /` endpoint. However, accessing this endpoint
from `transform` or `execute` action was not possible due to a lock conflict.
This has been fixed in 0.54.0.

```sh
cat /usr/share/dict/words |
  want="banana" fzf --listen --sync --bind 'start:transform:
    pos=$(
      curl -s localhost:$FZF_PORT?limit=$FZF_MATCH_COUNT |
      jq --arg want "$want" \
         ".matches | map(.text) | to_entries | map(select(.value == \$want)) | first | .key // -1"
    )
    [[ $pos -ge 0 ]] && echo "pos($((pos + 1)))+offset-middle"
'
```

* Find the offset of the word =="banana"== in the list and move the cursor to it.
* We use the new `offset-middle` action to place the current item in the middle of the screen.
* Thanks to the improved `--sync` behavior,
    * The initial filtering is already done when `start` event is triggered.
    * And you won't see the intermediate state before actions bound to `start`
      event are complete.

## Better handling of `reload` action on `start` event

If `reload` (or `reload-sync`) action is bound to `start` event, fzf will not
start the initial reader (built-in directory walker or `$FZF_DEFAULT_COMMAND`).

Previously, we would start fzf with an empty list to prevent it from doing the
unnecessary work (i.e. `: | fzf ...` or `fzf < dev/null ...`). This is no
longer necessary.

Not starting the reader also prevent extraneous `load` or `result` events from
being triggered.

This is a simple example, but it wouldn't work as expected before.

```sh
fzf --header 'Loading ...' --header-lines 1 --layout reverse \
    --bind 'start:reload:sleep 1; ps -ef' \
    --bind 'load:change-header:'
```

* Unless we start fzf with an empty list, it would print an invalid header line,
  because the initial reader starts and passes the first read line as the
  `--header-line`.
* Starting fzf with an empty list would fix the problem, but then an
  extraneous `load` event would fire and the `Loading ...` message would be
  removed before `reload` is complete.

## Better cache management and improved rendering for `--tail`

In the previous version, fzf would evict the cache too aggressively when using
the `--tail` option. Also, it would clear each line before rendering the new
line, causing flickering. This has been fixed in 0.54.0. You will notice the
difference if you're browsing a high-throughput stream.
