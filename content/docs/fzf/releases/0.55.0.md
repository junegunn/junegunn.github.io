# [0.55.0](https://github.com/junegunn/fzf/releases/tag/v0.54.0)

(August 2024)

## Exact-boundary-match type

fzf 0.55.0 added `exact-boundary-match` type to its search syntax. When
a search term is single-quoted, fzf will search for the exact occurrences of
the string with both ends at word boundaries.

```sh
fzf --query "'here'" << EOF
come here
not there
EOF
```

Unlike in regular expressions, this also sees an underscore as a word
boundary. But the words around underscores are ranked lower and appear later
in the result than the other words around the other types of word boundaries.

## Hyperlink (OSC 8) support

fzf now supports OSC 8 escape sequences for hyperlinks both in the preview
window and the main window.

```sh
printf '<< \e]8;;http://github.com/junegunn/fzf\e\\Link to \e[32mfz\e[0mf\e]8;;\e\\ >>' | fzf --ansi

fzf --preview "printf '<< \e]8;;http://github.com/junegunn/fzf\e\\Link to \e[32mfz\e[0mf\e]8;;\e\\ >>'"
```

## Comments in `$FZF_DEFAULT_OPTS` and `$FZF_DEFAULT_OPTS_FILE`

Line comments are now allowed in `$FZF_DEFAULT_OPTS` and in
`$FZF_DEFAULT_OPTS_FILE`.

```sh
export FZF_DEFAULT_OPTS='
# Layout options
--layout=reverse

--info=inline-right   # Show info on the right side of the prompt line

# ...
'
```

## Vim plugin update: `exit` callback

A spec for `fzf#run` can have `exit` callback that is called with the exit
status of fzf. This can be used to clean up temporary resources or restore the
original state when fzf is closed without a selection.

I added this to implement live preview of color schemes in `:Colors` command
of [fzf.vim](https://github.com/junegunn/fzf.vim) project.

* https://github.com/junegunn/fzf.vim/commit/04bfa8115716f9222fe307303f9803e7264ac303

Because the color scheme is changed on the fly on `focus` event, I needed
a way to restore the original color scheme when fzf is closed without
a selection.

## Bash completion: default completion for all commands

`fzf --bash` now sets up default completion so that fuzzy path completion is
enabled for any command with a custom completion defined.
