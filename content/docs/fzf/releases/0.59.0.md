# [0.59.0][0.59.0]

(February 2025)

[0.59.0]: https://github.com/junegunn/fzf/releases/tag/v0.59.0

## Highlights

* Enhanced `path` scheme to prioritize file name matches
* `click-header` event now sets `$FZF_CLICK_HEADER_WORD` and
  `$FZF_CLICK_HEADER_NTH`, allowing you to implement a clickable header for
  changing the search scope
* `search` and `transform-search` action to extend the search syntax of fzf
* `--header-lines-border` to display header from `--header-lines` with
  a separate border
* `--no-input` option to completely disable and hide the input section

## Prioritizing file name matches

Since fzf is a general-purpose text filter, its algorithm was designed to
"generally" work well with any kind of input. However, admittedly, there is no
true one-size-fits-all solution, and you may want to tweak the algorithm and
some of the settings depending on the type of the input. To make this process
easier, fzf provides a set of "scheme"s for some common input types.
i.e. `default`, `path`, and `history`.

This release enhances `path` scheme to prioritize matches occurring in the
file name of the path. Here is an example.

| `git ls-files \| fzf -qs` | `git ls-files \| fzf -qs --scheme=path` |
| ---               | ---                                |
| ==s==rc/LICENSE   | src/==s==erver.go                  |
| ==s==rc/ansi.go   | src/util/==s==lab.go               |
| ==s==rc/core.go   | .github/workflows/==s==ponsors.yml |
| ==s==rc/item.go   | ==s==rc/LICENSE                    |
| ==s==rc/tmux.go   | ==s==rc/ansi.go                    |
| ==s==rc/cache.go  | ==s==rc/core.go                    |
| ==s==rc/proxy.go  | ==s==rc/item.go                    |

You can see with `--scheme=path`, the matches with the search term occuring in
their names are prioritized over the rest.

### Automatic scheme selection

fzf will automatically choose `path` scheme
* when the input is a TTY device, where fzf would start its built-in walker or run `$FZF_DEFAULT_COMMAND` which is usually a command for listing files,
* but not when `reload` or `transform` action is bound to `start` event, because in that case, fzf can't be sure of the input type.

```sh
# Built-in walker is used, and --scheme=path is automatically applied
fzf

# fzf runs $FZF_DEFAULT_COMMAND, and --scheme=path is automatically applied
export FZF_DEFAULT_COMMAND='fd --type f --hidden'
fzf
```

However, this automatic selection may not always be desirable. If you observe
suboptimal behavior, explicitly specify the scheme you want.

> idea. I wanted more users to benefit from the enhancement without having to

> know if you have any feedback.

### Understanding the `path` scheme

`path` scheme does two things:

1. Adjust the scoring algorithm to give the highest bonus points to the
   matching characters after the path separators. Characters after whitespaces
   are given less bonus points.
     * On the contrary, in the `default` scheme, characters after whitespaces
       are given the highest bonus points.
1. Apply `--tiebreak=pathname,length` option

The additional `pathname` tiebreak is what's new in this release. It involves
more computation, so the `path` scheme will be slightly slower than the
`default` scheme. However, the difference in performance should be negligible
in most cases.

## `click-header` enhancements

When you click on the header, `click-header` event is triggered and it exports
the following environment variables.

| Variable                   | Description                                                                         |
|:---                        |:---                                                                                 |
| `$FZF_CLICK_HEADER_LINE`   | Clicked line number starting from 1                                                 |
| `$FZF_CLICK_HEADER_COLUMN` | Clicked column number starting from 1                                               |
| `$FZF_CLICK_HEADER_WORD`   | The word that was clicked ==*(new)*==                                               |
| `$FZF_CLICK_HEADER_NTH`    | The `nth` expression for the clicked word ==*(new)*==                               |
| `$FZF_KEY`                 | The name of the last key or event. Now it reports click types as well. `click`, `ctrl-click`, `alt-click`, `shift-click`, `double-click`, etc. |

You can use these variables, especially the last three, to implement a clickable
header that changes the search scope.

```sh
# Click on the header line to limit search scope
ps -ef | fzf --style full --layout reverse --header-lines 1 \
             --header-border bottom --no-list-border \
             --color fg:dim,nth:regular \
             --bind 'click-header:transform-nth(
                       echo $FZF_CLICK_HEADER_NTH
                     )+transform-prompt(
                       echo "$FZF_CLICK_HEADER_WORD> "
                     )'
```

Now the `kill` completion implements a more sophisticated version that allows
selecting/toggling multiple columns with `{ctrl,alt,shift}-click`.

* [zsh](https://github.com/junegunn/fzf/blob/4b74f882c79600e4a988146d037eabf1fc484c7d/shell/completion.zsh#L292-L323)

## `search` and `transform-search` action

The new `search` and `transform-search` action allow you to trigger an fzf
search with an arbitrary query string. This frees fzf from strictly following
the prompt input, enabling custom search syntax.

In the example below, `transform` action is used to conditionally trigger
`reload` for ripgrep, followed by `search` for fzf. The first word of the
query initiates the Ripgrep process to generate the initial results, while the
remainder of the query is passed to fzf for secondary filtering.

```sh
#!/usr/bin/env bash

# Controlling Ripgrep search and fzf search simultaneously

export TEMP=$(mktemp -u)
trap 'rm -f "$TEMP"' EXIT

INITIAL_QUERY="${*:-}"
TRANSFORMER='
  rg_pat={q:1}      # The first word is passed to ripgrep
  fzf_pat={q:2..}   # The rest are passed to fzf

  if ! [[ -r "$TEMP" ]] || [[ $rg_pat != $(cat "$TEMP") ]]; then
    echo "$rg_pat" > "$TEMP"
    printf "reload:sleep 0.1; rg --column --line-number --no-heading --color=always --smart-case %q || true" "$rg_pat"
  fi
  echo "+search:$fzf_pat"
'
fzf --ansi --disabled --query "$INITIAL_QUERY" \
    --with-shell 'bash -c' \
    --bind "start,change:transform:$TRANSFORMER" \
    --color "hl:-1:underline,hl+:-1:underline:reverse" \
    --delimiter : \
    --preview 'bat --color=always {1} --highlight-line {2}' \
    --preview-window 'up,60%,border-line,+{2}+3/3,~3' \
    --bind 'enter:become(vim {1} +{2})'
```

* As you can see, the first term `return` is passed to ripgrep, the primary
  filter, and the second term `abc` is passed to fzf, making it perform
  secondary filtering over the results from ripgrep.

{{< notice info >}}
Note that we bind the same `tranform` action to `start` and `change` at once.

```sh
--bind "start,change:transform:$TRANSFORMER"
```

This was not possible in the previous versions.

## Secondary border for the header lines

After experimenting with `--header-border`, I realized that there are cases
where you want to treat the header from `--header-lines` differently from the
header from `--header`. Here's an example. This is a classic use case of
`--header-lines`.

```sh
ps -ef | fzf --style full --layout reverse --header-lines 1
```

{{< figure src="/fzf/images/fzf-0.59-ps.png" >}}

Let's say you want to provide a binding for reloading the list, and tell the
users about it using the header.

```sh {hl_lines=[2]}
ps -ef | fzf --style full --layout reverse --header-lines 1 \
             --bind 'ctrl-r:reload(ps -ef)' --header 'Press CTRL-R to reload'
```

{{< figure src="/fzf/images/fzf-0.59-ps-header.png" >}}

Okay, but I'd prefer to have some visual separation between the two headers
because they serve different purposes. I used to add new line characters to
`--header`, but now we have a better option, `--header-lines-border`.

```sh {hl_lines=[3]}
ps -ef | fzf --style full --layout reverse --header-lines 1 \
             --bind 'ctrl-r:reload(ps -ef)' --header 'Press CTRL-R to reload' \
             --header-lines-border bottom --no-list-border
```

{{< figure src="/fzf/images/fzf-0.59-header-lines-border-bottom.png" >}}

Unlike the other border types, `none` option has a different meaning here. It
is used to still separate the two headers, but without an additional border.

```sh {hl_lines=[3]}
ps -ef | fzf --style full --layout reverse --header-lines 1 \
             --bind 'ctrl-r:reload(ps -ef)' --header 'Press CTRL-R to reload' \
             --header-lines-border none
```

{{< figure src="/fzf/images/fzf-0.59-header-lines-border-none.png" >}}

`--header-first` option will only affect the header from `--header`.

```sh {hl_lines=[3]}
ps -ef | fzf --style full --layout reverse --header-lines 1 \
             --bind 'ctrl-r:reload(ps -ef)' --header 'Press CTRL-R to reload' \
             --header-lines-border none --header-first
```
{{< figure src="/fzf/images/fzf-0.59-header-lines-border-none-header-first.png" >}}

## Hiding input section

`--no-input` option completely disables and hides the input section. You can
no longer type in queries. What good is it? You may want to use it to create
a very simple menu with no input capability.

```sh
(echo Yes; echo No) | fzf --height=~100% --no-input --reverse --style full
```

{{< figure src="/fzf/images/fzf-no-input-menu.png" >}}

Although we can't type in search queries, we can use the new `search` and
`transform-search` actions to trigger searches like in the example below.

```sh
# Click header to trigger search
fzf --header '[src] [test]' --no-input --layout reverse \
    --header-border bottom --input-border \
    --bind 'click-header:transform-search:echo ${FZF_CLICK_HEADER_WORD:1:-1}'
```

{{< figure src="/fzf/images/fzf-no-input-header.png" >}}

Here is another example that implements Vim-like mode switching.

```sh
fzf --layout reverse-list --no-input \
    --bind 'j:down,k:up,/:show-input+unbind(j,k,/)' \
    --bind 'enter,esc,ctrl-c:transform:
      if [[ $FZF_INPUT_STATE = enabled ]]; then
        echo "rebind(j,k,/)+hide-input"
      elif [[ $FZF_KEY = enter ]]; then
        echo accept
      else
        echo abort
      fi
    '
```

(`FZF_INPUT_STATE` is one of `enabled`, `disabled`, or `hidden`.)

Personally, I don't see myself using this feature much, but if you have
a creative use case, I'd love to hear about it.

## `bell` action :bell:

Last, and, yes, least. We have a new action called `bell` that rings the terminal bell. You can use it to provide feedback to the user.

```sh
# Press CTRL-Y to copy the current line to the clipboard and ring the bell
fzf --bind 'ctrl-y:execute-silent(echo -n {} | pbcopy)+bell'
```
