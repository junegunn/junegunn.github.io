# Tmux integration

## Tmux plugins

There are tmux plugins that utilize fzf for better experience.

### [junegunn/tmux-fzf-url](https://github.com/junegunn/tmux-fzf-url)

The one I enjoy the most is
[junegunn/tmux-fzf-url](https://github.com/junegunn/tmux-fzf-url). It allows
me to quickly open URLs in the browser with just a few key strokes. Highly
recommended.

### [sainnhe/tmux-fzf](https://github.com/sainnhe/tmux-fzf)

[sainnhe/tmux-fzf](https://github.com/sainnhe/tmux-fzf) allows you to perform
various actions on tmux using fzf. It's probably the most feature-rich plugin
out there so you might want to check it out.
